## Labs

### Blaze Pisonet Universal
ESP8266 timer/coin-control architecture with standalone and multi-unit concepts. Promotion requires exact-board compile, GPIO verification, persistence testing, failure recovery and multi-device validation.

### Blaze Pisonet Timer — Public-Safe Recovery
**Area:** ESP8266 timer / relay control  
**Status:** Lab / recovered derivative  
**Repository:** `BlazingSystems-Labs/embedded/blaze-pisonet-timer-public/`

Publication-safe derivative reconstructed from an earlier timer branch. The public source removes the embedded MP3 payload and uses a generated first-boot setup value while preserving the core coin-input, dual-relay, TM1637 display, local web configuration, persistence, sales-counter, and warning workflow. Historical source/audio remain outside public GitHub. Exact-board compile and hardware validation remain.

### BlazeFM
Lightweight Android file-manager project with duplicate and image-similarity tooling. Remaining work includes full Gradle/device validation, modern storage-permission regression testing and signed release packaging.

### MachDownload
Segmented HTTP/HTTPS downloader. Python syntax and local range-download integrity tests pass; wider Windows/CDN/proxy/authentication validation remains.

### Local AI Studio
Local HTTP-based image/utility engine with optional model adapters. Core server validation is separate from model/runtime performance validation.

### OpenWrt VLAN Deployment Study
Sanitized networking study covering VLAN and management design. Raw device backups, private keys and deployment credentials are intentionally excluded.

### ESPHole
**Area:** ESP8266 networking / DNS filtering  
**Status:** Lab / source-ready  
**Repository:** `BlazingSystems-Labs/networking/esphole/`

Independent ESP8266 DNS-sinkhole and NAPT-repeater study. The public edition generates and persists unique first-boot AP/admin credentials. Exact-board compile, DNS/NAPT behavior and multi-client hardware validation remain.

### BlazeTube ESP8266
**Area:** ESP8266 networking / shared browser sessions  
**Status:** Lab / source-ready  
**Repository:** `BlazingSystems-Labs/networking/blazetube-esp8266/`

Shared browser-session coordinator and NAPT-repeater experiment using a user-supplied YouTube Data API key and official embedded playback in client browsers. No API credential is bundled. Compile, service-integration and hardware validation remain.

---

## Experiments

### BlazePwifi
**Area:** OpenWrt / ESP8266 captive portal  
**Status:** Experimental alpha  
**Repository:** `BlazingSystems-Experiments/experiment/openwrt/BlazePwifi/`

Clean-room reconstruction of a PisoWiFi-style OpenWrt architecture with captive access control, accounting/session logic, installer/uninstaller paths, a documented ESP8266 vendo protocol and hardware validation boundaries. It does not redistribute the analyzed commercial firmware.

### EasyMode for OpenWrt
**Area:** OpenWrt management layer  
**Status:** 5.0.0-alpha.1 / static tested  
**Repository:** `BlazingSystems-Experiments/experiment/openwrt/easymode-project/`

Adaptive management/tooling project with Cellular, AP, Router, Switch, PC and Generic editions plus offline-HTML, Windows and OpenWrt installer families. Hardware verification remains required before broader promotion.

### ESPHole — Versioned Experimental Branch
**Area:** ESP8266 networking  
**Status:** Experimental version history  
**Repository:** `BlazingSystems-Experiments/embedded/esphole/`

Preserved numbered firmware iterations used for active ESP8266 DNS/NAPT development and regression work. The safer public Lab edition remains the deployment-oriented reference while the experiment branch preserves development history.


### BlazeAPK
**Current public build:** Beta 0.6

Browser-based APK/DEX parsing and Android-API compatibility research. The runnable public artifact is Beta 0.6; recovered Beta 0.7 material is design/implementation planning only and is not represented as a completed release. It is not presented as a replacement for Android Runtime/ART.

### BlazeJ2ME
**Current public build:** v1.6 universal compatibility fix

Single-file Java ME/JAR/JAD runtime experiment for compatibility research. The v1.6 artifact is the newest runnable build recovered so far; its JavaScript passes parser validation and it bundles no commercial JAR/JAD content.

### TokenLauncher
Android + ESP32 local token/device-control prototype. Security assumptions and unresolved kiosk/device-owner requirements are documented in the project.

### ESP8266 AP LED / Relay Controllers
Standalone access-point control experiments exploring lightweight embedded web interfaces.

### ESP8266 Arcade — Public-Safe Shell
**Area:** ESP8266 captive portal / networking  
**Status:** Experiment / recovered-design derivative  
**Repository:** `BlazingSystems-Experiments/embedded/esp8266-arcade-public/`

Publication-safe reconstruction of a recovered ESP8266 arcade architecture. The public source keeps captive DNS, a local web interface, generated AP credentials and optional NAPT support, but replaces the recovered emulator/ROM workflow with an original dependency-free mini-game. The raw recovered firmware remains outside public GitHub because its embedded portal included third-party runtime references and ROM-library behavior.

The public archive intentionally does **not** store raw employer/customer-era files, credentials, private network backups, proprietary forms, or confidential datasets.

## Publication Standard

Public project pages should contain:

1. purpose and scope;
2. current validation status;
3. requirements or target environment;
4. known limitations;
5. public-safe sample data;
6. preview/demo entry point where practical;
7. no confidential records, credentials or proprietary operational templates.

The portfolio is maintained as a technical engineering record rather than a raw development backup.


## Forked / Upstream Studies

Third-party/open-source experiments belong in **Forked-Projects** and must retain upstream attribution and licensing. Forked work is kept separate from original BlazingSystems portfolio projects so authorship remains unambiguous.
